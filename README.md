## 1. What is Cloud Computing?

```
      +-------------------+
      |  Cloud Provider   |
      +-------------------+
               |
      +-------------------+
      |   Internet        |
      +-------------------+
               |
      +-------------------+
      |   You (Customer)  |
      +-------------------+

## 2. CapEx vs. OpEx

|                | CapEx (Capital)         | OpEx (Operational)      |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **What**       | Buy upfront             | Pay as you use          |
| **Analogy**    | Buy a car               | Use Uber                |
| **IT Example** | Buy servers             | Rent servers (Azure)    |

## 3. Cloud Deployment Models

```
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|  Public Cloud  |     | Private Cloud  |     |  Hybrid Cloud  |
| (Azure, AWS)   |     | (Your DC)      |     | (Mix)          |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
```
- **Public:** Shared infra, scalable, low cost.
- **Private:** Dedicated, secure, costly.
- **Hybrid:** Mix of both, flexible.

## 4. Shared Responsibility Model

```
+-------------------+-------------------+
| Provider          | You               |
+-------------------+-------------------+
| Physical Security | Data & Access     |
| Network           | App Config        |
| Hardware          | User Management   |
+-------------------+-------------------+
```
- **Provider:** Handles hardware, infra, some security.
- **You:** Handle your data, access, and configs.

## 5. Consumption-Based Model

- **No upfront cost:** Start instantly.
- **Billed for use:** e.g., per hour, per GB.
- **Predictable costs:** No wastage.

## 6. Key Benefits of Cloud

```
+-------------------+-------------------+
| High Availability | Scalability       |
| Elasticity        | Reliability       |
| Security          | Manageability     |
+-------------------+-------------------+
```
- **High Availability:** Always online.
- **Scalability:** Grow/shrink as needed.
- **Elasticity:** Auto-scale up/down.
- **Reliability:** Self-healing infra.
- **Security:** Built-in tools, teams.
- **Manageability:** Portal, CLI, scripts.

## 7. TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)

- **Compares:** On-premises vs. Cloud total cost.
- **Includes:** Power, cooling, admin, hidden costs.
- **Result:** Cloud is usually cheaper.
